## 📂 Package Structure

The package is divided into two main parts as specified in the assignment:

### 1. [Collections & Streams](./collections_streams/README.md)
* **Lists (`lists`)**: A product management application using `ArrayList` to add, delete, and modify products, as well as searching for products by name.
* **Maps (`maps`)**: A student grade management system using `HashMap`. It calculates the average, maximum, and minimum grades and uses **Lambda expressions** for display.
* **Sets (`sets`)**: Manipulation of `HashSet` to perform **intersection** and **union** operations on student groups.

### 2. [Generics](./generics/README.md)
* **Part 1 (`GenericStorage`)**: A generic class capable of storing elements of any type (`Integer`, `String`, etc.) with fundamental management methods.
* **Part 2 (`IMetier`)**: Implementation of a generic business logic architecture with an `IMetier<T>` interface and an interactive console application to manage products.
