## 📂 Package Structure

The package is divided into two main parts as specified in the assignment:

### 1. [Input/Output](./input_output/README.md)
This section covers file system operations and object serialization/deserialization in Java.

* **Exercise 1 (`exercise1`)**: A command-line simulator that mimics the `ls` command, displaying directory contents with file types and permissions (read, write, hidden).
* **Exercise 2 (`exercise2`)**: A product management application using object serialization to persist data to a binary file (`products.dat`). Features include CRUD operations and file-based data storage.

### 2. [Exception Handling](./handling_exceptions/README.md)
This section focuses on robust error handling and exception management in Java applications.

* **Exercise 1 (`exercise1`)**: A calculator class that demonstrates exception handling for common errors (`ArithmeticException` for division by zero, `NumberFormatException` for invalid number conversions). Shows graceful error handling and user-friendly error messages.
* **Exercise 2 (`exercise2`)**: Implementation of a custom exception class `TooFastException` for vehicle speed validation. Demonstrates exception creation, throwing, catching, and stack trace display.
